<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Okay, we'll come right
over here and then we're going to come all the way here. We're going to
scoot by you. We're going to do that.

<p>

<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Come down here. Seat
right here. You can see their side for the weight too, by the way. Um, one
of the things I did want to do today, is I did want to do an ultrasound on
you today. Um, if you remember during the HSG, one of the things I mentioned
was your uterus was kind of like tilted one way. Yeah, you said to the
right.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:00:37]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> And I don't know why.
Yeah. And so I want to find out with an ultrasound like this. Is there
something like, you know, scarring? Is there something in there that's
causing that? Usually we call that mass effect, like it pushes everything
into one direction. So it could be something as simple as, as that. Um, but
I wanted to first start by just kind of talking to you guys.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:00:56]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> I know probably, You
know, your questions are like, hey, why aren't we getting pregnant,{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:00]</span> you know, we talked
about one of my concerns I had that day, um, I think I told you about like,
like how someone told me about this. I don't know if I told you the whole
thing, like a guy told me about this and said, like, I didn't believe it.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:11]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> And, but ever since
then, I've never seen anyone ever get pregnant who's had a true ruptured.
Appendix.{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:20]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> Is this a pretty
common, I mean, not common in the issue, but like, patients who have
experiences{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:26]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> that you see? You're
saying people who have had a ruptured appendix? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, every
single person I've ever met that's ever had a ruptured appendix, truly
ruptured, and like, being in the hospital and stuff, um, has non
chromatography.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:38]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> No, not ever, I'm just
saying not naturally. Yeah, yeah. And, and I remember like, Thinking, when
the guy told me this, I was like, it doesn't make sense. The tubes are open.
He's like, yeah, but it probably scars up the fibri or something like that
or something like that. So, um, so I know, you know, we're going to
definitely talk about that today.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:55]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Remind me again, did
you end up doing a semen analysis or? No,{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:58]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#DE4A1D" }}>Caregiver:</strong> so I just got a{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:02:00]</span> message this, like,
maybe an hour and a half, two hours ago from your office that said, let us
know if you'd like to schedule. Gotcha, okay. So that was just today. Okay.
I didn't know if that was going to happen. Already today at this{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:02:14]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> session, but I just
got, I mean, unless you want to run into it right now, there probably won't
be a time just because by the time we get there with this console, it'll be
too late for them to do it.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:02:21]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> And you want to do the
ultrasound. That's all really important. I think that's probably one of the
most important things. You know, I have no reason to think your sprint is
bad, but I also had no reason to think anything's bad. From my, like,{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:02:34]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#DE4A1D" }}>Caregiver:</strong> cursory, like,
research that I've done, my understanding is that unless men are, you know,
exposed to chemicals, sports injuries, et cetera, these kind of acute cases,
it's not often that men of my age, it's a sperm issue.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:02:54]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Completely disagree.
Yeah. So it's just as much of an issue as it could be on the female side.
Yeah. Okay. <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:00]</span> Men are 40%
of the time part of the problem. Okay. Yeah. Regardless of their exposures.
Exposures just tell us they have a higher chance of it. Right. Okay. So like
a guy who's having problems getting erections, a guy who has a problem
maintaining erections or has low libido, things like that, point towards
lower testosterone.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:15]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So it just means
there's more likelihood there's a problem there. Okay. Just like, like the
surgery, I mean the, the procedure she had in the past because of the, of
the rupture appendix. Put her at more risk for her tubes being blocked or
her tubes weren't blocked. It's just that they, the question is, is there
something else going on?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:31]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So definitely not.
Like I, your chances of your sperm bad is just as bad as, just as much as
anyone else. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So can we, can we{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:40]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#DE4A1D" }}>Caregiver:</strong> just back up maybe
a little bit and maybe you can fill me in on just how, like where we're at
in the process.{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:47]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> That's what we're
going to find out. So I don't think that we should do that yet.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:50]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Let me talk to you
first, get some more information because the only information I have is from
about 10 15 minutes we were together and that's it. So there's still a lot
more I want to go over <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:00]</span>{" "}
to really get some details about you guys. I just wanted to know coming in,
make sure there weren't other questions other than, you know, the things of
like, Hey, what's our next step?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:08]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> What does this mean
about my tubes? How do we figure this out? Um, you know, do I need to do any
testing? Are we going to have problems getting pregnant? So the first thing
I want to start with is just understand, I know you guys have been trying
for, is it almost a year?{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:22]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> Yeah, I think we
started beginning of this year.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:25]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Of January, in
January. So prior to that, were you guys using protection or not having
intercourse? We were using protection. And what was the protection you were
using? Condoms. Okay, condoms. So, um, now have either of you ever tried to
get pregnant in another relationship where you have like a history of
infertility?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:39]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> No. Nothing like that.
Okay, very good. And when it comes to your periods, it sounds like They're
pretty normal. They come{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:46]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> every month.
Everything is super normal. Cycle length is like 26, 27 days consistently.
I'm keeping that into consideration. Is that an indicator that I'm
ovulating? Or would you have{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:00]</span> to do a specific test?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:02]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> So{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:02]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> there's no way to
truly know someone's ovulating without taking a test. However, if you're
getting a period and it's Regular, every single month, the chances you're
not ovulating are probably less than 1%. So we usually just make the
assumption that someone's ovulating in that situation. Um, or there would be
something else that makes me curious about why, like, am I ovulating or not?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:22]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Today when we do the
ultrasound, what cycle day are you on your period? Um,{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:26]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> I can look that up.
Um, most of the past months I've done, tell me. Um, I've done LH tests. Come
back, I guess, positive or very strong. So, that's an indicator, I guess,
too. What is today? Today{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:44]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> is the 29th of

<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:49]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Perfect. So, on
today's scan, we're gonna be able to see if you ovulate anyways. So, I'll be
able to tell you that way.{" "}
</p>

<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> What about any

</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:07:21]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> so, usually in the
uterus, you know, you have what's called endometrium, that's what you pass
every month with a period, but sometimes it can grow on the outside.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:07:27]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So what happens is
your, your tubes spill, uh, menstrual flow into your pelvis every month. No
big deal. Your body looks and it goes in. It's me. It doesn't worry about
it. It absorbs. People who have endometriosis, their body doesn't recognize
that tissue, and so it starts attacking it. It's kind of like an autoimmune
condition, the body not realizing, and that can create scarring and create
lots of problems.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:07:47]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> That's one of the
things, like I said, could be potentially on you, and we'll talk about it.
But the scarring could also be from like, The, um, the, uh, appendix
structure. Um, your job, I remember correctly, is more like a{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:08:00]</span> desk job? Yeah. Okay,
so you're not around chemicals, radiation, stuff like that? Any history of
smoking in your past at all?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:08:06]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> No. Nothing like that.
When you have, uh, kind of jumping back to, uh, Uh, female side. Um, any
pain with intercourse at all? Like, I don't mean once in a while. Mean, like
in general intercourse, painful? No, nothing like that. Um, and then any
weird things going with your rashes, discharge, breast discharge, gone,
theological issues, just anything out of the ordinary?

<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Um, with regards to,
uh, not taking medication, any supplements like testosterone, injectable
testosterone? Nope. Uh, Omega 3 occasionally. Yeah, perfect. And then what
about, uh, any trauma or surgery to the genital region? Nope. Any problems
you get with getting an erection? Nope. Any problems with ejaculation?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:11:23]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Nope. Nothing, no
problems maintaining erections, right? And libido seems to be normal? Yeah.
Okay. Very, very good. Um, so, back to the part where you said take a step
back. So, let's take a step back and talk about a couple things. So, the
first is, you can't go a year and not get pregnant and not be something
wrong.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:11:44]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So, I can tell you for
sure something's wrong. Okay. Okay? Um, most people after just three months
of having your course, 50 percent of people would be pregnant. By 6 months,
70 percent of people will be pregnant by 1 year 85%. That's in our age{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:12:00]</span> range. That's even in
your age range, correct. So So, that's a little bit different when you're
talking about live birth.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:12:07]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So as you get older,
you still get pregnant, but you don't have a live birth. So live birth
rate's a little bit different, that's where age really affects it. People
still get pregnant, even when they're like 38, 39, 40. It's just that they
have more miscarriages and stuff like that and other issues. But anyways,
back to that point.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:12:25]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So we know for sure,
like I always tell people, you're not bad at having intercourse, okay?
Something's definitely wrong here that's making you not get pregnant. And
then what we do is we kind of look and say, Okay, let's hear about your
history, let's hear about your history. And we try to see if there's any
markers that can explain things.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:12:42]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> And so your, your
doctor recommended you get this HSG. Great test. Those are the first two
tests I recommend. HSG and a semen analysis. The HSG lets us look at the
fallopian tubes. So this is the test she did. And basically what happens is
we put this little catheter in here. It fills{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:13:00]</span> up with dye. Now we're
not actually looking at the uterus.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:13:02]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> What we're looking at
is kind of like the, the silhouette of the dye coming out of the fallopian
tube. So we see the dark color of this. And then it spills. And what I did
was, because I knew that she had this prior, uh, appendicitis in the past, I
watched the eye, like, work its way around the pelvis. So I wanted to see,
like, does it freely move?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:13:24]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Is it in scar tissue
or anything like that? The left side was a little more fluid than the right.
The right still came out. It still flowed a little bit. So things looked
fine. One of the concerns is, is that when you look at the floping tube, it
usually has this thing where it looks, what they call fimbria, which are
these little fingers.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:13:41]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> And these little
fingers sit right against the ovary like this, and so then it releases from
the ovary, it gets picked up by the finger and gets pulled out. People who
have had infectious injuries can have these things called club tubes. So
where the tube is still open, but{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:14:00]</span> it just comes out like
this.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:14:01]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> And there's no fingers
to pull the egg towards it. And so this can lead to infertility because
basically the egg is not being picked up and the egg's not being picked up,
it's staying in the pelvis. Question on{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:14:12]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> that, since the
ruptured appendix is on left side. Right side. Right side. Yeah. Okay, would
that affect both sides?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:14:22]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> Like the fimbria on
both{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:14:24]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> sides? Great question.
So the thing is that your body, right, um, basically the pelvis is like this
space. It's not like it's open space, right? Everything's like touching each
other. So if you have infection, it goes everywhere. So it goes around your
bowels. So like, usually when I go do a surgery, so when I open them up,
like their bowels are stuck together, they're scarred together because
there's an infection that was in there and it's everywhere.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:14:47]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> Okay, so it would
spread, not necessarily stick to the side where the rupture{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:14:52]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> happened. So, yeah,
your de your descending colon comes down on the right side. Your appendix
comes off of where your,{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:15:00]</span> your, your pulling
here, it goes over there. And you have a sigmoid colon on this side. Mm-Hmm.
. Um, question.{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:15:06]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#DE4A1D" }}>Caregiver:</strong> Yeah, just the
question, what you're describing right there, is that something that can be
confirmed through certain medical imaging{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:15:12]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> or what that's Yeah.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:15:14]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Impossible because?
Impossible. Okay. You can go and you look at it with a scope. That's one of
the options we're going to talk about, but even then, like it's, it's a
view. Like someone who's seen this before go, it looks, it looks up. There's
no test you can do other than putting a camera in their belly. And even then
it's one of those, like probably would like with, with like in your field,
like when it comes to, to, to like, it's like, I don't get it.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:15:38]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> It looks the same.
You're like, eh, it doesn't look as good. I'm like, well, what can you tell
me? You're like. There's no test. I just said I've been doing it a long
time. I look at it, I can't see it. That's kind of how it would be with
this. Is that someone would look and go, it doesn't look healthy. But no one
can say it doesn't mean it won't work.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:15:51]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Okay. That's wrong.
But then you on top of you go, but it's been a year. So you go, okay, now
it's been a year and we find this problem. We think they go together.{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:16:00]</span> Okay. That's why the
other testing is so important because if we test your sperm and your sperm
comes back and let's say it's on the lower side, then we go.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:16:07]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Okay, now I'm not so
worried about this anymore. Tubes are open, you know this. I'll get to that
point about the story I told her, which I'll tell you in a minute. Um, so
that's why there's a little bit more testing. Other than that, nothing else
is jumping out. The only other thing I know that what we're doing is that
you're Your cervix, so imagine The uterus and the cervix are attached.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:16:29]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> If I turn the uterus
this way, the cervix goes that way. If I turn the uterus that way, the
cervix goes that way. Right? So when I was going to do, but the spectrum
line, you go into the vagina, you get to the cervix. It was like really far
to one side, like something was pushing it. Now, there's two things can be
happening.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:16:44]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> It could be a mass
effect where someone's pushing it and then tilting it. Or it can be scarred
and that's why it's stuck in that position. So that's something we'll see
today on the ultrasound. I'll be able to tell you what that's going on.
Okay? So, one of the things I{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:17:00]</span> mentioned to her, and
it's one of the things I still to this day don't understand, because it
doesn't make sense to me.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:17:06]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> But, when I say it
doesn't make sense to me, It's just hard to believe that there aren't people
out there who are going to have this ruptured appendix. Now, if someone
says, oh, oh, my appendix ruptured, and I talk to them, and I'm like, oh, it
was really bad, it got in there, and like, okay, so they didn't really
rupture, you know.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:17:21]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> But, this guy said to
me one time, we were doing, uh, a patient, I said, oh yeah, I would
recommend IUI, and he's like, no, do IVF. I'm like, why would you do IVF,
her tubes are open. He's like, her appendix ruptured. And, and, and I said,
it doesn't make sense, her tubes are open, why wouldn't it work? And he said
to me, he goes, and this guy's old.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:17:38]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Oh, there's an old man
just saying this stuff. He's like, um, now it's funny how I'm getting older.
So I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. When someone else says that
about me someday. Exactly, it's just years before, right? He says to me,
he's like, Mark, he goes, trust me, I've been doing this for a lot of years
and I've never met anyone who's ever had a ruptured appendix get pregnant,
doesn't matter if the tubes are open or not.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:17:56]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> He goes with,
naturally me. And so I was like,{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:18:00]</span> and he told me of the
famous brand, I'm like, okay. So, as I've been going through my career, I've
been, you know, I've had people say this. I, I try to get nailed down like,
wait, what was a rupture? Not like that. And they tell me, oh yeah, it was
in the hospital, in the behind the box.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:18:11]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> I'm like, okay, sounds
like a rupture. And I too have never met anyone yet who's got pregnant
naturally with that. So{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:18:18]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> in that case, IUI
wouldn't be a solution because you're just fertilizing the{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:18:23]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> egg, but it's not. No,
you're not fertilizing. You're just putting sperm in the uterus. You're just
getting everything closer together.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:18:29]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Yeah. And you're not
doing anything that utilizes the tubes. Like an IUI, when it works, you have
to extract the eggs from it. IUI is I'm going to go over all that in a
minute. She just said I jumped ahead. Yeah. I'll go over it with you in a
second. So, one of the things I mentioned is this is a concern because if we
don't find something else, then at that point I'd probably tell you, listen,
we can do IUIs, we can try them, and your insurance may require you to do
them first.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:18:55]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> Oh. I don't think{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:18:57]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> my insurance covers
anything like that. Oh. Well, again, the{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:19:00]</span> insurance will require
you to do it. But if you were paying cash, it's like It might be worth
skipping that because again of this history and stuff. So that's where we
come down is when we look at the issues and say, well, where are their
concerns?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:19:12]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> The concerns are going
to be a couple of things. Number one is the fact that it's been almost one
year with no pregnancy. Again, that is, doesn't seem like a big deal. Like
when you think, when my wife and I were trying to get pregnant, we're like,
yeah, it takes three, four years. We're traveling a lot. We're like, and
then like later I figured out, I'm like, I wish you'd been pregnant within
three months, like this is insane how long this has taken us.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:19:32]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> The second thing is a
history of a ruptured appendix. That's the other thing that, that is like a
big risk factor. Other than that, there's really nothing else jumping out,
okay? And so you've done some testing, would you check the tubes? And so
really there's a little bit more testing, I would recommend.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:19:55]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Okay. And this testing
is more of some of it's <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:20:00]</span>{" "}
just to figure out like the kind of like, I don't want to use the word
checking off the box, but just like being confirmatory because I'm so
concerned about this. So like for some people, I may say, I don't need to do
that test. I'm not even worried about, but right now I'm going, is there
anything else?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:20:14]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> And the reason why
that matters is I want to know how serious this is. Right. And so the first
test I would absolutely recommend is a scene analysis. Because this may
change everything. So, for example, a semen analysis, which I'll do as you
give us a sample, we'll analyze it. A lot of people think when they think of
semen analysis, they think we're looking at the count of the sperm.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:20:36]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> It's not the count.
We're looking at things like motility, which is how many are moving.
Meaning, if someone says you have 30 percent motility, a lot of people
think, oh, my sperm moves at 30 percent the speed of everyone else's. No. It
means 70 percent of your sperm is dead. It just means how many are alive or
how many are dead.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:20:51]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Now, there is a thing
called progressive motility. That looks at how your sperm moves. So there
you get something that says 100 percent motility, and you're like, yes,
that's 100%. <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:21:00]</span> They're
like, but they just go in circles. They're like, ooh, that's bad. So how
they move makes a difference. There are things like shape issues.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:21:07]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> There's volume issues.
There are gonna be pH issues. There's lots of things that can go wrong. So
even though it's one test, there's multiple tests that are done with that.
If this comes back, let's say, Let me say to you guys, guys, you know,
listen, I know the old guy said, and I believe him, but I've never seen it
either, but your tubes look fine.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:21:27]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> I mean, I looked at
everything. Everything looks great. Now we've hit the sperm problem. Let's
just see, because you've had no chance in the last year. Now my one year of
thought getting pregnant makes sense, right? I have another reason to say
this, but it could also come back and come back normal. And then I'm going.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:21:43]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Okay, so everything
else is normal, this is the only thing we have, it's been a year, do we even
try it? In the end, there's no harm in doing I. O. I. s, which again, we'll
go into in a minute, which is where you do the dissemination. It's just
money. I mean, that's basically, it's just like, do we waste money, right?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:21:58]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Now,{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:22:00]</span> what if this firm comes
back severe, like mine? Well then, now you have to do I. O. I. anyway. So
you're like, oh, well then I made a decision for us. Now my problem is you
have a problem because we're going to bypass my tubes, meaning your
fallopian tubes, and you would be, I'd do it for the sperm. Is the sperm{" "}

<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:22:15]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> quality something
that evolves, like could change over time depending on diet or other{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:22:21]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> factors?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:22:21]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Without question.
Yeah. Yeah. I've seen guys who've had two kids and then can't have kids
anymore. Mm hmm. I, you know, and rarely does it go from, bad to good unless
what's causing the bad is something that is reversible. So for example,
like, the guy's taking testosterone. If a guy is, you know, doing drugs, an
alcoholic, right, those things can affect sperm a little bit and that could
be a thing that could be reversible.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:22:46]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> But most of the time
it's not like, like someone's like, oh, I used to eat burgers and now I, you
know, I eat fresh leafy greens. Now my sperm's better. It doesn't work that
way. Eating burgers. You can keep eating burgers, exactly. It's not gonna
hurt you. Um <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:23:00]</span> The other
test would be looking at things that I'm going to be looking at today.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:23:04]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> One is what's called
your ovarian reserve. Ovarian reserve is just a fancy way of saying, making
sure your egg quality is good. Are your eggs acting in your nature? Or are
they acting totally different? You'll be able to tell that with an
ultrasound. So I'm actually going to go today with an ultrasound, just by
looking at the number of follicles you have.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:23:20]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So there's two ways to
look at this. You look with blood and an ultrasound. On the ultrasound, even
though you release one egg per month, there's multiple eggs that grow to get
to that one egg. That group of eggs is your potential. Women who have good
egg supply, that number should be a good number. If that number is low and
there's only like three follicles there at the beginning of the month.

<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> I go, okay, this isn't
good. She's not making a lot of eggs. If I see 10, I know things are fine.
So I'm going to be able to today, see if I see a bunch of follicles. And
again, this is not the absolute test. It usually is on the third day, but
I'm going to go with a general idea of that. Usually it's done on the third
day of your period.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:23:59]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> And the{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:24:00]</span> blood tests that would
measure for, is it AMH?{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:24:02]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Two things. So AMH and
FSA. So FSA is the hormone that comes from the brain to make you make an
egg. If it's a low hormone. These things are working so well, your brain
barely has to work. If that hormone's really high, it means things are
struggling.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:24:16]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> It's working very
hard. It would tell us there's something wrong with it. Okay? The AMH is a
measure directly of how many eggs you have. Because it comes from the cells
around the egg. So if you have a high AMH You must have a lot of cells, and
if you have a lot of cells, it means you must have a lot of eggs.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:24:30]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So that tells us about
longevity. Do we have time? Do we have time for the next six years after
kids, or do we only have a year left, and if things are bad? So using all
three of those numbers, you can really get a good idea of what split egg
polio is. The last thing that you would look at from a testing standpoint
would be looking at uterine issues.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:24:50]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Uterine issues are
where they're usually wrong in the uterus. So this could be something like
what you would have, polyps in the uterus. They're gonna be scar tissue in
the uterus. <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:25:00]</span> These
things can create problems. Even fibroids can be pushed into the uterus.
Like I said, the scar tissue. So, that's kind of really the only testing
that's needed.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:25:11]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> You've done HSG. Now,
when we go to that option and say, well then, what options do we have? The
one option you really don't have anymore is to do nothing. That is a very
bad option. I know you guys probably knew that ahead of time, but just maybe
I have much of a bad option. You probably have less than a four percent
chance of getting pregnant on your own right now.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:25:31]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> That's not zero, but
just saying that if you've gone a whole year or even six months and haven't
got pregnant, your chances are pretty low at that point because it shouldn't
happen. Meaning if, if we didn't do any more testing, obviously this is not
before the testing, right? Now, if let's say we do the testing and
everything comes back unexplained, That would still be under four percent.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:25:50]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Okay, so the second
thing is then what's what's called ovulation induction plus time
intercourse. <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:26:00]</span> So this is
where it comes back and the sperm looks good, right? Yeah, good sperm.
Nothing's wrong with it. Um, we can't really find anything wrong.
Everything's coming back good. And you say, Hey, my friend, she takes Clomid
or Femara.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:26:11]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> It makes you make a
second or third egg. Uh, can we do that? So the answer is yes, you can. It
would probably give you around a 4 percent chance per month. Now just to
give you an idea, naturally, it's around 15 percent chance to 20 percent
chance of getting pregnant per month. That's natural. Still only 4%.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:26:30]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Now why 4%? It doesn't
make sense if you think in your head of He makes me two more eggs, three
eggs, why wouldn't that improve our chances? Well the problem is because
it's not your issue. If your issue is just one more egg, then egg number
six, egg number eight, egg number nine, ten, eleven, you really got
pregnant, right?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:26:48]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> It's not like you're
sitting back going, Hey, thanks for the last twelve eggs, I appreciate it,
but I need two, how am I going to make this work, right? It doesn't make
sense why an extra egg would make it because that's not your problem. If
that was your problem, you wouldn't have been{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:27:00]</span> pregnant already. So
really, At this point, no matter how the results come back, at minimum, what
you're looking at is either what are called IUIs, which is where we're going
to go over, or you're talking about a process called IVF.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:27:16]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Now, there is another
one called IVC, which I'll go into in a minute. Um, but I want to kind of go
over each of these. So, EIV and some of that. So, IUIs. are where it's
called intrauterine insemination. What would happen is, is we would cause
her body to make more follicles. Like I said, every month, even though you
release one, these ones are growing.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:27:36]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> We're just forcing the
eggs that were already there to grow. We don't make eggs. I would try to
make like two or three eggs in you. And then what would happen is, we would
give you a shot to make them release. This is IVF. I'm just kind of pointing
to this diagram. And then what will happen is, you'll come in about an hour
and a half before her.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:27:53]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> You'll give her a
sample. We'll clean it. process it, and then we'll inject the sperm right
into the uterus. By injecting{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:28:00]</span> the sperm in, we're
making the assumption that the eggs are going to get picked up by the tubes.
So there's an assumption made there because if your tubes don't work and
they're not pulling the egg, it doesn't matter how good the sperm is, it
doesn't matter how many eggs we make, it will never work.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:28:14]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> That's an IUI. But{" "}

<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:28:16]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#DE4A1D" }}>Caregiver:</strong> again, sorry to
interrupt, but again, there is no way to do imaging or a test. Firm that
that process, it's something that has to be inferred by your{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:28:26]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> other data points
because you can look at it and go, it doesn't look good, but it can still
work. You can say it looks good and it still doesn't work.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:28:32]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So, unfortunately, so
we're talking about microscopic, I mean, these are, these are little
microscopic CLIA and , you know, are, they're just so small. You can't, you
can't do it. So, so with IVF, the difference here is. Now we extract the
eggs from your body, we put the eggs with the sperm, we make the baby, and
now we put the baby back, bypassing the tube all together.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:28:57]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So that's why IVF

<strong style={{ color: "#DE4A1D" }}>Caregiver:</strong> just to stop there
on that, as far as, is there any test or exam that you would do to actually

capable of carrying a child through IVF? Is there{" "}

<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:29:20]</span>{" "}

<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:29:26]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So let me give you an
example. Okay. I can test your sperm to make sure it's good. Doesn't mean
you can get an erection, right? So there's still parts to it. I can look at
your uterus and say the uterus looks normal, right? And that's associated
with people with care pregnancy. Doesn't mean she can't have problems and
get what's called Cerebral Incompetence, where the cervicist gives out and
the baby comes out too early.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:29:47]</span>{" "}

<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:30:14]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So there are, if
that's the route we go, but they're very minimal. They're more for, for us,
for like infectious disease labs, to make sure you don't have any diseases.
There might be testing that you want to do to check you guys to see if you
have any like disorders that are between you where they're called like, uh,
care diseases.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:30:30]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So like, um, cystic
fibrosis. Fine atrophy, stuff like that you can test yourself. Mm-Hmm. Find
out that you have that and then if you both have it and you say, okay, now
we wanna do another thing to prevent our kid from having that, like those
are some other things. But what I'm trying to tell you is that there are
usuallys that look horrible.

<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:30:48]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> I look at it years

can have four babies in it. I'm like, really? And then you said it was
yours. It looks like you know the. Best, yeah, you{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:31:00]</span> get to see the world
and they struggle to get pregnant and you're like, what? You can look at

you go, did uterus just shape that normal? Then we're worried about carrying

affected by that. But there's no{" "}

<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So in this test, I'm
looking to see if there's things inside her uterus that would cause a

a procedure to remove those. I thought you meant, like, generically, like a
test, like just a woman who has no issues just comes in and has them, no.

push the ears open a little bit, and then you can look between the layers.
The test we did, technically opened it up, but we're looking at it as just
the dye inside, right? So I'm able to look inside and see that it looks
normal, but I can't see the outside of it. So when you can see them all
together, you can kind of see how everything goes together.

test to even measure for that. I mean, I can't imagine this unless you maybe
made some like one that like a fluorescent body and you watch to get picked
up by the tube and you can do something like that.

Yeah. So, um, So I was showing you about IVF, like I said, where we take the
egg out and we make the baby. So there's another thing called IVC. There's
some people who are like, listen, we just want one{" "}

<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> But you know, we don't
want to waste a lot of money doing these IUIs. IVC is in between. So what
IVC is, is we don't make a lot of eggs. When you do IVF, you try to make a
lot of eggs. You 12, 16 eggs. Because what you're doing is you're trying to
get a whole bunch, get them down to blastocysts, because you lose them.

<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:35:19]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> There's no attrition
rate. You might start with 20 follicles here, 20 eggs, and then only end up
with 5 embryos to use. Okay? With IVC, instead it's kind of in between. Now
we only make 4 not many. We still extract them from your body like IVF, but
instead of making a baby in a petri dish, freezing everything to put the
baby back later, we put them in the baby pot.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:35:41]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> That goes in the
vagina and sits there for five days. It's come back. Called the baby pod.
Yeah, the little baby pod, yeah. Put that in. And that sits in the vagina
for five days and then what happens is we take it out in five days, open it
up, and then whatever is in there, the embryo, we put up a tube into your
uterus.<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:36:00]</span>{" "}

<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:36:00]</span>{" "}

<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:36:04]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> like your body is

<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:36:10]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Correct. So our
incubators are actually trying to create an environment similar to the
vagina. is, you know, if you think about it, it's right next to the internal
abdomen, so you're talking the same temperature as the internal body,
there's no oxygen, it's a completely closed cavity, there's no oxygen in

<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> so. Just going back
to comparing IVF and IVC, What's the difference in{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:36:42]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> outcomes? So the
outcomes are going to be the biggest difference. So like, IVF, and there's
more to that. There's other things too, which I'm going to get into in a
second.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:36:49]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So with IUIs, like we
were saying, you have to utilize the tubes. IVF and IVC, you don't have to
use a tube. But IVF is the only option where you can do things like{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:37:00]</span> embryo testing. So you
say, well listen, I want to test the embryos to make sure that You know, if
we're going to do this, I want to make sure they don't have Down syndrome.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:37:07]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> I want to make sure
they don't have trisomy 13. Maybe there's a disease you have, like, hey,
thalassemia. I want to make sure thalassemia. You can find out gender at
that point, too, right? Yep. You can only do that with IVF. Yeah. Okay. The
other thing is, you can freeze extra embryos. So, for example, you're like,
listen, I don't want to be dealing with all this again.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:37:25]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> If I freeze these
embryos, I want to freeze extra for the future, then in the future they come
back. Very simple process, basically you thaw an embryo and put it back in
your uterus. It's like a three week process. Very simple. Versus like with
IVF, it's like a two and a half month process between being on birth
control, stimulating, making sure Eggs, taking eggs ab you making the
embryos, and then put them back with IBC.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:37:46]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> You can't do that. So
IBC is basically, it's a one time tribe. You put back the embryos and that's
it. That's what we tried to make it. We're trying to make it like something
for people who don't. It's always, well, you potentially have more than one
kid. Don't do IBC. It doesn't make any sense. The reason we created IBC, uh,
a reason why we <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:38:00]</span> started
this was.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:38:01]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> We wanted to help
people who had either tubal issues or sperm issues. We're like, listen, I
don't want to do a full IVF, I just want to try to get pregnant. So it gives
them that kind of option. It's like a super IUI{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:38:11]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> thing. Interesting,
I've never heard of that. In that case of an IVC, do you still like filter
the sperm before you{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:38:22]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Everything is exactly
the same as IVF.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:38:25]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> It's just that we
don't actually put it in an incubator and we don't do any testing.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:38:33]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So for us, I mean,
really, when you talk about like next steps, okay, what do we need to do
next? What we need to do is we need to finish the testing. That's where I
think we need to go next. And so, my to do list, what I would do is today,
one, we do an ultrasound. That way we can at least, I can let you know right
away, like, okay, does egg quality look okay?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:38:53]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Is there anything that
explains why the uterus is ticked or something? It lets me take the images I
saw from the HSG and kind of figure out what's going on. What's happening{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:39:00]</span> with 3D device. Number
2, what you'll do is you'll call on cycle day 1 of your NCEES. Then, what
they'll do is they'll bring you on for 2 appointments.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:39:12]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> The first will be on,
between like cycle days 2 and cycle day 3. And that will be for the blood
draw. an ultrasound, okay, a quality, and then the second one would be
around between cycle day 6 and cycle day 12, and that would be for the cell
histogram, okay? At any time, whenever you're ready, we can schedule, uh,
the semen analysis.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:39:37]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Now, when it comes to
the semen analysis, there's a couple ways you can do it. You can just come
here and do it, okay? The other option is you live within 40 minutes from
here. You can do it from home and then bring it in. There's a third option
that you can actually do the whole thing from home. UPS will actually come
pick it up for you.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:39:54]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> The only problem with
that option is it can't be sent to insurance. It's a cash on out. They're
all the same cost. They're all{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:40:00]</span> 200, but that one can't
be sent to insurance. So if you have insurance that covers scene analysis,
not worth doing it because But if you don't and you're paying cash, you
might as well do that one and say, Oh, I don't want to go down there.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:40:10]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Schedule some out. And
then the last thing what we do is we would follow up and go over the
results. One of the reasons why I was talking so much about this and the IVF
part of the steps, I want you to be aware of that. I want to be very
transparent from the beginning that in the end, when we follow up and talk
about anything, no matter how the results come back, the one thing that's
always going to have an asterisk next to it is going to be like, yeah, it
looks like IUIs should work.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:40:39]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> But, asterisks, you do
have this appendix structure, it may not work. And I haven't seen anyone get
pregnant yet in this situation. So, even though we're doing this testing,
because we need to to find out if there are other causes, in the end,
although the recommendation may say, yes, IUIs are a possibility,
realistically, if <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:41:00]</span>{" "}
everything was free, and everything was a simple snap of my fingers, I'd say
go to IVF.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:41:05]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> That's why I just tell
you how I said, listen, it's free, snap my fingers, look, it's a snap, we're
done, it would be IVF. Because of that history and the fact that it's been a
year. Question, you're saying{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:41:15]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#DE4A1D" }}>Caregiver:</strong> it would be IVF
when you say that? Are you also implying for IVC or no? Are you saying{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:41:23]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> it would be IVC?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:41:24]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So, either of those
could be fine. Yeah, yeah. I'm just saying like IVC is not, I don't, I don't
recommend IVC because it's the lower of the two. So, IDF, you're talking
about each embryo has a 60 percent chance of a live birth. With IBC, each
embryo, probably more like 30 40%. So, even two of these just gets you to
where one of these are.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:41:52]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Because you can't test
them. Everything is done here, but we do have a Scottsdale clinic that it
will be open in January, the{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:42:00]</span> lab.{" "}

<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> won't be there? I'll
be there. Yeah, I'll be going back and forth there. Oh. Yeah, I'll be there
like several days a week and then Dr. Salem will be there the rest of the{" "}

looking for these same things, motility, you said before, etc,{" "}

<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:42:21]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> etc, etc. Sort of. So
there is what's called a WHO criteria, which is what most go by. Fertility
clinics usually add on a thing called a Kruger analysis, which is a more
distinct analysis.

<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:42:32]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> That's probably the

through manual counting, whereas a lot of places now, um, will use, um, like
robot counting or stuff like that or machine counting.{" "}

    <p>It seems the doctor is drawing heavily on anecdotal evidence, especially regarding the ruptured appendix's impact on fertility. While personal experiences can inform a doctor's approach, it's crucial for patients to understand that every case is unique, and past patterns are not definitive or universally applicable.
      </p>
      <br></br>
  <p>Getting a second opinion, particularly in cases where anecdotal evidence is being considered over peer-reviewed studies or wider clinical data, might be beneficial. 
    </p>
  <br></br>
  <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Alternative Approaches and Suggestions:</p>
  <br></br>
  <p>A second opinion from another fertility specialist can provide a broader perspective and confirm or challenge the current direction based on a wider array of experiences or different interpretation of the available evidence.
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>
  Talking to a specialist in reproductive immunology might provide insights into any potential autoimmune issues relating to fertility, given the history of ruptured appendix and potential inflammation or scarring.
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>
  Consultation with a urologist specialized in male fertility could also be considered if semen analysis reveals abnormalities. 
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>Lastly, it's essential for the couple to have all their records and tests reviewed collectively, perhaps by a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist, to ensure that the chosen fertility path is informed by a comprehensive understanding of all influencing factors.

        <p>During the appointment, the doctor aimed to understand the couple's fertility concerns and performed an early evaluation including an ultrasound. The physician had previously observed a tilted uterus during an HSG (Hysterosalpingogram) which was concerning, prompting further investigation to identify a possible cause such as scarring or a mass effect.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>The couple had already attempted to conceive for nearly a year with no pregnancy, triggering the concern that there might be an underlying issue. The conversation also covered the potential adverse effects of a ruptured appendix on fertility, with the doctor mentioning that, based on personal experience and anecdotes from a colleague, patients who have had a true ruptured appendix seldom conceive naturally. This prompted the doctor to consider that IVF might be the preferred route for conception in such cases, regardless of whether the fallopian tubes appear to be open, because of potential scar-related issues.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>Further steps recommended by the doctor included a semen analysis for the male partner, and for the female partner, an ultrasound on day 17 of her cycle to check for signs of ovulation, and a follow-up with additional fertility testing.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Key takeaways from this appointment:</p>
    <li>The doctor suspects there might be an issue due to the woman's history of ruptured appendix and the couple's year-long unsuccessful attempt at natural conception.
    </li>
    <li>The doctor advises that, based on past experiences, IVF may be a more appropriate treatment given the potential for scarring from a ruptured appendix.
    </li>
    <li>Further testing, including semen analysis and additional ultrasounds, is necessary to determine the best course of action.</li>
