<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Okay, we'll come right
over here and then we're going to come all the way here. We're going to
scoot by you. We're going to do that.

<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Come down here. Seat
right here. You can see their side for the weight too, by the way. Um, one
of the things I did want to do today, is I did want to do an ultrasound on
you today. Um, if you remember during the HSG, one of the things I mentioned
was your uterus was kind of like tilted one way. Yeah, you said to the
right.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:00:37]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> And I don't know why.
Yeah. And so I want to find out with an ultrasound like this. Is there
something like, you know, scarring? Is there something in there that's
causing that? Usually we call that mass effect, like it pushes everything
into one direction. So it could be something as simple as, as that. Um, but
I wanted to first start by just kind of talking to you guys.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:00:56]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> I know probably, You
know, your questions are like, hey, why aren't we getting pregnant,{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:00]</span> you know, we talked
about one of my concerns I had that day, um, I think I told you about like,
like how someone told me about this. I don't know if I told you the whole
thing, like a guy told me about this and said, like, I didn't believe it.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:11]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> And, but ever since
then, I've never seen anyone ever get pregnant who's had a true ruptured.
Appendix.{" "}

<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:20]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> Is this a pretty
common, I mean, not common in the issue, but like, patients who have
experiences{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:26]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> that you see? You're
saying people who have had a ruptured appendix? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, every
single person I've ever met that's ever had a ruptured appendix, truly
ruptured, and like, being in the hospital and stuff, um, has non
chromatography.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:38]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> No, not ever, I'm just
saying not naturally. Yeah, yeah. And, and I remember like, Thinking, when
the guy told me this, I was like, it doesn't make sense. The tubes are open.
He's like, yeah, but it probably scars up the fibri or something like that
or something like that. So, um, so I know, you know, we're going to
definitely talk about that today.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:55]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Remind me again, did
you end up doing a semen analysis or? No,{" "}

<strong style={{ color: "#DE4A1D" }}>Partner:</strong> so I just got a{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:02:00]</span> message this, like,
maybe an hour and a half, two hours ago from your office that said, let us
know if you'd like to schedule. Gotcha, okay. So that was just today. Okay.
I didn't know if that was going to happen. Already today at this{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:02:14]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> session, but I just
got, I mean, unless you want to run into it right now, there probably won't
be a time just because by the time we get there with this console, it'll be
too late for them to do it.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:02:21]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> And you want to do the
ultrasound. That's all really important. I think that's probably one of the
most important things. You know, I have no reason to think your sprint is
bad, but I also had no reason to think anything's bad. From my, like,{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:02:34]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#DE4A1D" }}>Partner:</strong> cursory, like,
research that I've done, my understanding is that unless men are, you know,
exposed to chemicals, sports injuries, et cetera, these kind of acute cases,
it's not often that men of my age, it's a sperm issue.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:02:54]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Completely disagree.
Yeah. So it's just as much of an issue as it could be on the female side.
Yeah. Okay. <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:00]</span> Men are 40%
of the time part of the problem. Okay. Yeah. Regardless of their exposures.
Exposures just tell us they have a higher chance of it. Right. Okay. So like
a guy who's having problems getting erections, a guy who has a problem
maintaining erections or has low libido, things like that, point towards
lower testosterone.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:15]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So it just means
there's more likelihood there's a problem there. Okay. Just like, like the
surgery, I mean the, the procedure she had in the past because of the, of
the rupture appendix. Put her at more risk for her tubes being blocked or
her tubes weren't blocked. It's just that they, the question is, is there
something else going on?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:31]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> So definitely not.
Like I, your chances of your sperm bad is just as bad as, just as much as
anyone else. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So can we, can we{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:40]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#DE4A1D" }}>Partner:</strong> just back up maybe
a little bit and maybe you can fill me in on just how, like where we're at
in the process.{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:47]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> That's what we're
going to find out. So I don't think that we should do that yet.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:03:50]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Let me talk to you
first, get some more information because the only information I have is from
about 10 15 minutes we were together and that's it. So there's still a lot
more I want to go over <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:00]</span>{" "}
to really get some details about you guys. I just wanted to know coming in,
make sure there weren't other questions other than, you know, the things of
like, Hey, what's our next step?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:08]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> What does this mean
about my tubes? How do we figure this out? Um, you know, do I need to do any
testing? Are we going to have problems getting pregnant? So the first thing
I want to start with is just understand, I know you guys have been trying
for, is it almost a year?{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:22]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> Yeah, I think we
started beginning of this year.
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:25]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Of January, in
January. So prior to that, were you guys using protection or not having
intercourse? We were using protection. And what was the protection you were
using? Condoms. Okay, condoms. So, um, now have either of you ever tried to
get pregnant in another relationship where you have like a history of
infertility?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:39]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> No. Nothing like that.
Okay, very good. And when it comes to your periods, it sounds like They're
pretty normal. They come{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:04:46]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> every month.
Everything is super normal. Cycle length is like 26, 27 days consistently.
I'm keeping that into consideration. Is that an indicator that I'm
ovulating? Or would you have{" "}
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:00]</span> to do a specific test?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:02]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> So{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:02]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> there's no way to
truly know someone's ovulating without taking a test. However, if you're
getting a period and it's Regular, every single month, the chances you're
not ovulating are probably less than 1%. So we usually just make the
assumption that someone's ovulating in that situation. Um, or there would be
something else that makes me curious about why, like, am I ovulating or not?
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:22]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> Today when we do the
ultrasound, what cycle day are you on your period? Um,{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:26]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#6600CC" }}>Patient:</strong> I can look that up.
Um, most of the past months I've done, tell me. Um, I've done LH tests. Come
back, I guess, positive or very strong. So, that's an indicator, I guess,
too. What is today? Today{" "}
</p>
<p>
<span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:05:44]</span>{" "}
<strong style={{ color: "#72B372" }}>Doctor:</strong> is the 29th of
November. I'm on day{" "}

today's scan, we're gonna be able to see if you ovulate anyways. So, I'll be

    <p>It seems the doctor is drawing heavily on anecdotal evidence, especially regarding the ruptured appendix's impact on fertility. While personal experiences can inform a doctor's approach, it's crucial for patients to understand that every case is unique, and past patterns are not definitive or universally applicable.
      </p>
      <br></br>
  <p>Getting a second opinion, particularly in cases where anecdotal evidence is being considered over peer-reviewed studies or wider clinical data, might be beneficial. 
    </p>
  <br></br>
  <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Alternative Approaches and Suggestions:</p>
  <br></br>
  <p>A second opinion from another fertility specialist can provide a broader perspective and confirm or challenge the current direction based on a wider array of experiences or different interpretation of the available evidence.
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>
  Talking to a specialist in reproductive immunology might provide insights into any potential autoimmune issues relating to fertility, given the history of ruptured appendix and potential inflammation or scarring.
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>
  Consultation with a urologist specialized in male fertility could also be considered if semen analysis reveals abnormalities. 
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>Lastly, it's essential for the couple to have all their records and tests reviewed collectively, perhaps by a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist, to ensure that the chosen fertility path is informed by a comprehensive understanding of all influencing factors.

        <p>During the appointment, the doctor aimed to understand the couple's fertility concerns and performed an early evaluation including an ultrasound. The physician had previously observed a tilted uterus during an HSG (Hysterosalpingogram) which was concerning, prompting further investigation to identify a possible cause such as scarring or a mass effect.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>The couple had already attempted to conceive for nearly a year with no pregnancy, triggering the concern that there might be an underlying issue. The conversation also covered the potential adverse effects of a ruptured appendix on fertility, with the doctor mentioning that, based on personal experience and anecdotes from a colleague, patients who have had a true ruptured appendix seldom conceive naturally. This prompted the doctor to consider that IVF might be the preferred route for conception in such cases, regardless of whether the fallopian tubes appear to be open, because of potential scar-related issues.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>Further steps recommended by the doctor included a semen analysis for the male partner, and for the female partner, an ultrasound on day 17 of her cycle to check for signs of ovulation, and a follow-up with additional fertility testing.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Key takeaways from this appointment:</p>
    <li>The doctor suspects there might be an issue due to the woman's history of ruptured appendix and the couple's year-long unsuccessful attempt at natural conception.
    </li>
    <li>The doctor advises that, based on past experiences, IVF may be a more appropriate treatment given the potential for scarring from a ruptured appendix.
    </li>
    <li>Further testing, including semen analysis and additional ultrasounds, is necessary to determine the best course of action.</li>
